This is a sample project to demonstrate how to integrate Facebook Pixel functionality into React applications using Context and Hooks.

It was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

** You MUST HAVE to know how Facebook Pixel works and how to test a pixel event on facebook business dashboard, because it`s out of the scope explaing the concepts behing this **


First, run the development server:

- copy the file .env.template to .env.local and fill with pixel id code

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
